The MASTERMIND.C file is the mastermind game coded in C. 
The MAIN.C file is the mastermind game coded for 3DS. 
I cannot get it to work as a playable 3DS game, it should work theoretically but a lot of the documentation for DevKitPro is old and hard to keep track of.
I really hoped it would work but I kept trying and I couldn't get it to work as a playable .cia file for the 3DS.
