The MASTERMIND.C file is the mastermind game coded in C. 
The MAIN.C file is the mastermind game coded for 3DS. 
I have yet to try it as of (9/6/24) a 3DS game, it should work theoretically but a lot of the documentation for DevKitPro is old and hard to keep track of.
Hopefully I pick this project up again, it took a lot of effort to get where it is now it just needs a final push.
